Project Description and Goals
This project is a listing page clone inspired by Airbnb, designed to showcase various property listings in a user-friendly, responsive layout. The primary goal is to replicate the core functionality and visual design of the Airbnb listing interface, including listing cards, filters, and basic navigation — all built using modern web technologies. This project aims to improve frontend development skills, component-based architecture design, and user experience (UX) best practices.
